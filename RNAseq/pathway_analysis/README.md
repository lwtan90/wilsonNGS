# Pathway Analysis  
  
## Introduction  
Recently, I have grown quite a bit of interest in trying out various R packages for biological pathway analysis.
These tools are designed for RNA-seq, but with appropriate modification, they should work for other experimental data as well (such as CHIP-seq/ATAC-seq/WGS/etc). 
For the purpose of this documents, I will used the differential expression analysis output published in NASA Genelab (microaaray? I know right?).  

Disclaimer: I am not the creator of any of these packages.  

## Packages
